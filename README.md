# PromptPCB-Hackathon-2025
## Overview
PromptPCB is a tool designed to streamline the PCB design process, making it more accessible for students, hobbyists, and professionals. It allows users to generate circuit board schematics using natural language prompts, leveraging AI to simplify the design process.


## Features
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Converts user text prompts into PCB schematics.
* **Atopile API Integration:** Automates schematic generation.
* **Web-based Interface:** Built with Flask and React for accessibility.
* **AWS Hosting:** Ensures deployment and scalability.


## Technologies Used
* **Flask** (Backend API handling)
* **React** (Frontend interface)
* **Atopile API** (PCB schematic generation)
* **AWS** (Hosting and deployment)


## Challenges Faced
* **Sparse API Documentation:** Limited Atopile API resources made integration difficult.
* **AI Integration Complexity:** Ensuring accurate translation of user prompts to schematic designs.
* **Scoping Adjustments:** Initial goals were ambitious, requiring realistic MVP adjustments.


## Future Improvements
* **3D Model Generation:** Automate the creation of PCB models for production.
* **Auto-Routing for KiCad:** Enhance component placement and routing efficiency.
* **Open Web UI:** Replace custom AI chat interface with an open-source alternative.


## Contributions
This project was completed as part of a 24-hour hackathon with a team of four, emphasizing rapid prototyping, teamwork, and problem-solving under time constraints.
